# LaCasita
We wanted to make it easier for people to find their own home. Therefore we thought about issues people face nowadays and two of the biggest pain points seem to be the misisng transparency as well as the missing knowledge whether a property is fair valued and how the price is driven. In that manner we want to contribute to: The transparent housing market of the future - LaCasita!
