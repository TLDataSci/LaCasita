# LaCasita
We wanted to make it easier for people to find their own home. Therefore we thought about issues people face nowadays and two of the biggest pain points seem to be the misisng transparency as well as the missing knowledge whether a property is fair valued and how the price is driven. In that manner we want to contribute to: The transparent housing market of the future - LaCasita! 
## What the project does
The project goal is to enable people to undertand a property valuation by a breakdown into the features, that creates the most value for homes. Even though it can be used to also increase the selling price, but understanding what brings more value, the focus is on the home buyers:
- Property value estimation
- Recommendation system, that eases the process of finding a suitable property (incl. recommendations on how to find a better property, when defining the requirements, such as area, price or number of bathrooms)
- Display the information in a user friendly way
